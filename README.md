# Handwritten-Digits-Classifier

This classifier uses the MNIST dataset (found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ ) and the LeNet-5 architecture.

This will be useful to those starting on their Deep Learning journey in PyTorch, and already have a good grasp on Python programming and fundamentals of neural networks and
CNNs.

Understanding that this code is mostly for beginners, I will be uploading another version of the notebook that has copious comments and additional code to help understand
PyTorch and a basic DL classifier better.

The PyTorch blitz and the documentation was referred to.
